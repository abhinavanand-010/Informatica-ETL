# Informatica ETL Project

## Overview

This **Informatica ETL** project demonstrates the extraction, transformation and loading of data from multiple sources, transforms it using complex business logic, and loads it into a centralized data target. All the Database Principles are applied to ensure the cleaning and normalization of the data.

## Project On Hostel Management System

This project automates data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) for a Hostel Management System, organizing student, room, and fee data for streamlined management. The transformed data supports business intelligence by enabling detailed reports and insights into occupancy rates, fee collection, and resource allocation.

## Project Description

The project utilizes **Informatica PowerCenter** to design workflows that connect to diverse data sources, such as CSV files, relational databases, etc. These workflows handle the following key operations:

- **Data Extraction**: Extracts raw data from multiple sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Applies business rules to cleanse, aggregate, filter, and format the data for analysis. This process includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and computing derived fields.
- **Data Loading**: Loads the transformed data into the targets, ensuring it's available for analytics and reporting.

### Key Features:
- Automated workflows that can be scheduled to run at specific times.
- Error handling mechanisms that ensure smooth execution, even when issues arise (e.g., unavailable data sources).
- Support for real-time and batch processing of data to provide timely insights.

By transforming raw data into a structured form, this project helps organizations make informed decisions based on accurate, consistent, and up-to-date information.
